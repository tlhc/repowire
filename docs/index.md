# Repowire

Repowire is a local-first harness for working with more than one coding agent at a time. It gives every live Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, or Pi session an address in a shared mesh, so agents can ask each other questions, send updates, schedule follow-ups, and coordinate without copy-paste handoffs.

Think of it as the lightweight operating layer around your agent team: a communication mesh, an orchestrator path for multi-repo work, and a set of human controls for when you want to steer from a browser, Telegram, or Slack.

Use it when one repo needs a concrete answer from another repo, when you want a personal orchestrator session to dispatch tasks and collect status, or when you want to monitor and nudge agent work from your phone or browser.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/prassanna-ravishankar/repowire/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
```

Requires macOS or Linux and tmux. The installer downloads a checksum-verified native release; Python is not required. See [Install](start/install.md).

## First ask

Open two agents in tmux windows:

```bash
# window 1
cd ~/projects/project-a && claude

# window 2
cd ~/projects/project-b && codex
```

Claude Code registers on session start. Codex registers on session start too:
through the App Server when started with `--remote unix://`, else through its
SessionStart hook. Confirm both peers with
`repowire peer list`, then in `project-a`:

> Ask project-b what API endpoints they expose.

The agent calls the `ask` MCP tool. `project-b` receives the question and acks back with `ack(corr_id, "...")`. The reply lands in `project-a` framed as `[ack #cid from @project-b] ...`.

Repowire is not a standalone chat UI in this flow. You ask your local agent in natural language, and that agent invokes Repowire's MCP tools.
