# Setup

```bash
repowire setup
```

This is the one-time install step. It runs from your shell, not from inside an agent.

## What setup does

For every agent runtime it finds, the Go CLI wires the appropriate Repowire
transport. Auto-detection covers Claude Code, Codex,
OpenCode, and Pi. Then it installs the Go daemon as a user service (launchd on
macOS, systemd on Linux). When Codex exposes an App Server Unix listener, setup
also installs its independent thread bridge. Codex's SessionStart,
UserPromptSubmit, and Stop hooks are installed either way; they defer to the
bridge for App Server threads.

Setup also removes Repowire-owned legacy Gemini CLI and Antigravity entries.
It preserves unrelated settings and leaves custom retired-backend spawn keys
inert; old defaults inserted by Repowire are removed.

When setup finishes, the daemon is listening on `127.0.0.1:8377`. Open a new agent session in any directory and it will register itself.

`repowire setup` owns Repowire's transport and routing layer. It does not install third-party skills or Claude Code marketplace plugins; those can be installed separately if you want reusable agent behaviors on top of the mesh.

## Useful flags

```bash
repowire setup --relay                  # also connect to the hosted relay at repowire.io
repowire setup --experimental-channels  # use the experimental channel/ACP transport (Claude Code v2.1.80+, claude.ai login, bun)
repowire setup --http-mcp               # accepted for compatibility; /mcp is configured by setup
repowire setup --update-checks          # let status/doctor report new Repowire releases
repowire setup --non-interactive        # take flag values only, no prompts
```

`--relay` makes the dashboard available at `https://repowire.io/dashboard` over an outbound WebSocket. See [relay access](../use/features/relay-access.md).

`--experimental-channels` replaces the default hook/native-inbox bridge with
direct MCP-channel / ACP delivery for Claude Code only. For Repowire-managed
Claude spawns it also adds Claude's explicit development-channel opt-in to the
configured default command. Without the flag, setup removes that Repowire-owned
opt-in and Claude Code 2.1.224+ uses its authenticated native session inbox.
Custom Claude spawn commands must include the channel opt-in explicitly or
setup fails loudly without rewriting them. Channel mode is experimental. See
[Claude Code setup](../use/features/connect-claude-code.md).

Setup always enables the localhost-only `/mcp` implementation and generates a
`daemon.auth_token` if needed, because agent runtimes reach it through
`repowire mcp`. That stdio command is a small Go proxy which preserves the
runtime's daemon-minted peer identity; it does not duplicate the MCP tools.
`--http-mcp` remains accepted for older scripts. Direct HTTP clients must send
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` and, without the stdio identity proof, act as
the restricted `mcp-http` caller.

`--update-checks` opts this machine into update availability checks from `repowire status` and `repowire doctor`. It only reports that a newer release exists; `repowire update` remains the explicit command that upgrades the installed binary and re-runs setup.

## Verifying

```bash
repowire status
```

Shows what was installed, which agents were detected, and whether the daemon is running. If something looks off, see [troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/index.md).

You only run `repowire setup` once per machine. Next: [open two agents and route an ask](first-ask.md).
