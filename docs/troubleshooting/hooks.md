# Hooks not firing

A peer never registers, or stops appearing in `list_peers` after a session restart. Almost always a hook configuration problem.

## Quick check

```bash
repowire status
repowire doctor
```

If a runtime is detected but its hooks are marked missing, run `repowire setup` again. Re-running is idempotent and will rewrite the hook entries.

`repowire doctor` also checks that the daemon, `tmux`, and `git` are available.
Re-run `repowire setup` to reinstall both runtime integrations and the
server-global tmux lifecycle hooks used for pane exits and renames.

## Per-runtime diagnostics

### Claude Code

1. Open `~/.claude/settings.json`. The `hooks` key should contain entries for `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `Notification`, `Stop`, `StopFailure`, and `SessionEnd`, each pointing at `repowire hook ...`.
2. Confirm `repowire` is on `PATH` for the shell Claude Code was launched from. Hooks shell out, so a missing `repowire` in `PATH` silently no-ops.
3. Start Claude Code in a tmux pane. After your first prompt, run `repowire peer list` in another shell. Peer should appear within a few seconds.
4. On Claude Code 2.1.224+, `/status` should show a `Peer address` and `repowire peer describe NAME` should report `transport: claude-inbox`. If native delivery fails, Repowire logs the socket error under `~/.cache/repowire/logs/ws-hook-*.log` and returns a failed delivery receipt. There is no keystroke fallback.

If the hook reports `pane_identity_mismatch` after tmux has restarted, the pane
id may have been reused while an ownership record from an older tmux session
remained on disk. Repowire discards that stale bootstrap record automatically.
It still rejects path or placement mismatches within the same live tmux session,
because those records may authorize destructive pane operations.

### Codex

A Codex thread hosted by the App Server (`codex --remote unix://`) is
registered, steered, and reported by the bridge; the hooks step aside for it
except for the Stop reminder. Check `repowire service status` and
`~/.repowire/codex-bridge.log`. A standalone `codex` TUI registers through its
SessionStart hook and stays online through the ws-hook sidecar. Check the
`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, and `Stop` entries in `~/.codex/hooks.json`,
that Codex trusts them (`/hooks`), and `~/.cache/repowire/logs/ws-hook-*.log`.
Inbound messages to a standalone TUI are queued and surface after its next
turn; push delivery needs the App Server.

### OpenCode

OpenCode does not use shell hooks. It uses a TypeScript plugin at `~/.config/opencode/plugins/repowire.ts`. If the peer never appears:

1. Confirm the plugin file exists and is non-empty.
2. Check OpenCode's log for plugin load errors.
3. Re-run `repowire setup` to rewrite the plugin file.

## Daemon must be running

All hooks shell out to the daemon over HTTP. If the daemon is down, hooks
succeed (they do not block agent startup) but no peer state changes. A later
Claude Code `UserPromptSubmit` repairs a missing pane registration with the
current session's authenticated inbox. It also replaces a connected ws-hook
whose Claude inbox socket belongs to an older process, rather than accepting a
status-only recovery that cannot deliver messages. A failed SessionStart is
never retained as an empty ws-hook identity. See [Daemon unreachable](daemon.md).

## After upgrading `repowire`

Hooks call the installed `repowire` binary. Native upgrades keep the `~/.local/bin/repowire` symlink stable. If you install to a different location, re-run `repowire setup` so hook entries pick up the new path.
